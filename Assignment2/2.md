# The Second Assignment on the List

## Question

```text
Consider two series:
i) x + 2x + 3x + 4x + ..... + nx
ii) x + 2x^2 + 3x^2 + 4x^2 .... + nx^2

Input the values of n and x using the scanner class. Write a Java program to check if the value of 'n' is even or odd. If the value of 'n' is odd, write a loop to compute series i. If the value of 'n' is even, write a loop to compute series ii.

Explain the logic by creating pseudo-code and a brief explanation.

*P.S Python was used in this case.*

## Answer

***Pseudo Code***

```text
For this problem you need the following:
1. Get your inputs value of both x and n.
2. Check if the n value is either even or odd.
3. Specify the sum of series to be equal to 0, e.g res = 0
3. Compute the specific series with the value of n and x.
    If n is odd:
        a. Loop through from 1 to n, i.e for i in range(n).
        b. Multiply the value of i to x.
        c. Add this value to res.
    If n is even:
        a. Loop through from 1 to n, i.e for i in range(n).
        b. Multiply the value of i to x^2 (this can be done outside the loop to reduce time allocation).
        c. Add this value to res.
4. Return the computed value
```

### Code

```python
def checkSeries(n, x):
    res = 0
    if n % 2 != 0:
        series = 'x + 2x + 3x + 4x + ..... + nx'
        for i in range(n):
            val = i*x
            res += val
    else:
        series = 'x + 2x^2 + 3x^2 + 4x^2 .... + nx^2'
        valX = x**2
        for i in range(n):
            val = i*valX
            res += val

    return f'The input value is x:{x} and n:{n}. This series used was {series} and the result is {res}'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(input('Enter x value: '))
    n = int(input('Enter n value: '))
    print(checkSeries(n=n, x=x))
```
