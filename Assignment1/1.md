# The First Assignment on the List

## Question

```text
A Java programmer experiences the following approximate running times for a program that reads a digital photo of standard size 4x6 inches from a folder with thousands of photos, for varioues values of N (where N represents the number of photos read). Write a Java program to calculate the time required to read 150 photos in hours. Explain the logic by creating pseudo-code and a brief explanation.

        N   |   time                       |     time in minutes
    --------+------------------------------+--------------------------
        1   |   just over 30seconds        |     0.5
        5   |   just under 3minutes        |     3.0
        50  |   about half an hour         |     30.0

*P.S Python was used in this case.*
```

## Answer

***Pseudo Code***

```text
Looking at the problem and converting the time to minutes, it can be found to be arithmetic series of a=0.5 and d computed as follows:
    aN = a + (n-1)d
    n = 5 (5th term in this case) and aN = 3
    therefore, d = (aN - a) / n-1
    d = (3 - 0.5) / 5-1 = 2.5 / 4 = 0.625 = 0.6

To compute aN for a given value of n, the formula is used:
    aN = 0.5 + (n-1)*0.625
    This equation is used in the function.

Note: d gets lower for a larger dataset
```

### Code

```python
def getTime(n=150):
    return 0.5 + (n-1)*0625

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(getTime())
```
